### Data:
The paper for the replication study was found at the *[American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.3.905)* and the data was obtained from the *[Open ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112360/version/V1/view)* in the form of text files. The data describes the residential and commercial real estate in Allegheny County in Pennsylvania post 1995 <br/>

This repository will contain the team's work required for the project check-ins as well as the final submission.

The following are the 5 project check-ins:

Project check-in 1: Group formation, identification of target paper and itâ€™s key scientific claims, and the key figures to focus on for replication \
Project check-in 2: Identification of data, tools and infrastructure necessary \
Project check-in 3: Replication of the key figures \
Project check-in 4: Peer review \
Project check-in 5: In class presentation \
