### Content:
The purpose of this repository is for the team to collaborate on a replication study for the DATA 598 A course and will contain all the work required for the project check-ins and the final submission. The aim of the project is to replicate a key scientific claim of one of the papers published in the American Economic Review. Based on two factors - the observed variation in land prices and housing values per unit of land, the paper has provided an algorithm to identify the housing supply function per unit of land. This in turn is used to derive an estimate of the underlying production function. The approach yielded plausible estimates for the price elasticity of housing supply per unit of land, based on data from Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. For the project, the team wishes to replicate the figures that plots the estimates of the supply function and the production function.

Estimating housing production functions is challenging, as the quantity and price per unit of the housing services are not observed by the econometrician. Replicating the study helps us to understand how the underlying production function is estimated by treating prices and quantities of housing services as latent variables, without relying on strong functional form assumptions. \

### Data:
The paper for the replication study was found at the *[American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.3.905)* and the data was obtained from the *[Open ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112360/version/V1/view)* in the form of text files. The data describes the residential and commercial real estate in Allegheny County in Pennsylvania post 1995 <br/>
